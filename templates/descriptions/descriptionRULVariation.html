    <p class='description'>Below demonstrates how the estimated remaining lifetime of an engine decays over time. As an engine is used for flights, it undergoes a variety of conditions which over time cause it to decay in quality. This data allows us to make predictions on when the engine may fail, and therefore advise us on when to schedule maintenance.</p>
