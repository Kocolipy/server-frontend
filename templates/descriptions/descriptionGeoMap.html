    <h1 style="text-align: center;">Aircraft routes</h1>
    <p class='description'>This graph demonstrates the current flight routes taken by the aircrafts, all in one place. A circle represents an airport, and the lines represent the flight paths taken. This, alongside other data available on the application, allows us to determine which flights are more damaging to an engineâ€™s lifetime, and which flights will require the most maintenance.</p>
    <p class='description'>The original dataset did not contain any geographical data, hence the flight routes were generated (at random) from a dataset provided by <a href="http://openflights.org/data.html">openflights</a>. The whole geographical dataset found here is a redistribution of a subset of their database, and is provided in accordance with the <a href="http://opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/1.0/">Open Database License</a> and the <a href="http://opendatacommons.org/licenses/dbcl/1.0/">Database Contents license</a>, as a free service.</p>
