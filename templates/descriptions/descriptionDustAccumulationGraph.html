    <p class='description'>Below is a graph demonstrating the cumulative build up of dust exposure to an aircraftâ€™s engine against its lifetime. As aircrafts completed flights, dust is accumulated in the engine, potentially causing problems. This graph allows us to observe the rate at which the engine is accumulating dust.</p>
