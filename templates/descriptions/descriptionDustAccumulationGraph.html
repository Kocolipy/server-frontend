    <p class='description'>Below is a graph demonstrating the cumulative build up of dust exposure to an aircraftâ€™s engine against its lifetime. During flights, the engine is exposed to large quantities of dust, potentially causing problems. This graph allows us to observe the rate at which the engine is accumulating dust.</p>
