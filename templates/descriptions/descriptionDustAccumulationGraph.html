    <p class='description'>Below is a graph demonstrating the cumulative build up of dust exposure to an Aircraftâ€™s engine against its lifetime. As an Aircraft completed flights, dust is accumulated from the sky into the engine, which can potentially cause problems. This graph allows us to see the rate at which the engine is accumulating dust.</p>
