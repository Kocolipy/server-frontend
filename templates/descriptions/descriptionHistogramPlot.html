    <p class='description'>The below graph demonstrates three values for each aircraft chosen: The number of cycles the engine has been successfully running for; the predicted remaining number of cycles in the engines lifetime and the summation of these, demonstrating the total expected lifetime of the aircraftâ€™s engine. Comparing different aircraft allows us to determine which routes and which engines are lasting longer, and which will need more regular maintenances.</p>
