    <h1 style="text-align: center">Distribution of Cycles</h1>
    <p class='description'>The below graph demonstrates three values for each aircraft chosen: The number of cycles the engine has been running for; the predicted remaining number of cycles before maintenance is required and the summation of these, demonstrating the total expected lifespan of the aircraftâ€™s engine. Comparing different aircraft allows us to determine which routes and which engines are lasting longer, and which will need more regular maintenances.</p>
