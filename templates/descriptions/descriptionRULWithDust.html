    <p class='description'>This graph demonstrates both the predicted remaining cycles of an engine before maintanence is required, and its dust exposure. Throughout flights, engines are subject to varying levels of dust, which can be a factor in the decaying of the engines' health. This data allows us to see the strength of this correlation, more specifically it allows us to infer links between dust exposure and engine health.</p>
